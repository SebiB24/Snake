# 🐍 Snake Game in Java

## 🎮 About the Game
This is a **classic Snake game** built using **Java and Swing**. The game features smooth movement, food collection, and a score system. The goal is to **eat food to grow** while avoiding collisions with the snake’s own body. If you crash into yourself, it's **Game Over!**

## 🛠️ Features
✅ Smooth and responsive movement
✅ Collision detection with food and snake’s body
✅ Wrap-around mechanics for seamless movement across boundaries
✅ Score tracking
✅ Game restart functionality
✅ Simple and fun gameplay

## 🚀 How to Run
### **Prerequisites**
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (Java 8 or later)
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support

### **Running the Game**
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.

## 🎮 Controls
- **Arrow Keys (⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️):** Move the snake in the desired direction
- **Restart Game:** Press any key after Game Over

## 🔧 How it Works
The game is developed using **Java Swing** and relies on **KeyListeners** for movement. The core logic includes:
- **Snake movement** with queued inputs for smooth direction changes
- **Food placement** at random locations
- **Collision detection** with walls and itself
- **Score increment** when eating food
- **Game-over condition** when colliding with itself
- **Game restart** when a key is pressed after losing

## 🏗️ Future Improvements
🔹 More advanced movement mechanics
🔹 Power-ups (e.g., speed boost, invincibility)
🔹 Improved UI with a main menu and settings
🔹 Sound effects and background music
